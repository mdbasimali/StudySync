        His score of 129 in the IPL Qualifier 2 is the
        highest individual score in IPL Playoffs history. Gill was appointed as
        the captain of Gujarat Titans ahead of IPL 2024 after Hardik Pandya was
        traded to Mumbai Indians. Early life Gill was born on 8 September 1999
        into a Punjabi Jat Sikh family in Fazilka, Punjab, India.[10][11] His
        father, Lakhwinder Singh, is a farmer who aspired to become a cricketer.
        He has an elder sister named Shahneel Gill.[12] He showed early promise
        in cricket, picking up a bat at the age of three. Recognising his
        interest in the game, Lakhwinder decided to train him, bowling 500 to
        700 balls to him daily.[13] In 2007, he moved the family to Mohali, near
        the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, to facilitate better training
        opportunities for Gill.[14][15] At the age of twelve, Gill's performance
        caught the attention of former Indian bowler Karsan Ghavri, who
        recommended that Gill attend the Under-19 all-India pace bowlers' camp.
        Gill faced U-19 bowlers in the nets, leading Ghavri to request PCA to
        put him into Punjab's U-14 team.[16] In an Inter-District Under-16 match
        against Amritsar, Gill, representing Mohali, scored 351 runs and shared
        a record opening stand of 587 runs with Nirmal Singh. At the age of 14,
        he scored a double-century on his Under-16 debut for Punjab in the Vijay
        Merchant Trophy.[17][18] Domestic career Gill made his List A debut for
        Punjab in the 2016–17 Vijay Hazare Trophy on 25 February 2017 against
        Vidharbha, during which he scored 11 runs before being run out.[19] In
        his second match against Assam, he scored his maiden List A century,
        scoring 121 runs off 129 balls.[20] His first-class debut came against
        Bengal in the 2017–18 Ranji Trophy on 17 November 2017.[21] Later in the
        same month, in his second first-class match, he scored his maiden
        century while batting for Punjab against Services. He scored 129 runs
        off 142 balls.[22] In October 2018, Gill was named in India C's squad
        for the 2018–19 Deodhar Trophy.[23] In the final round-robin match
        against India A, he scored an unbeaten century, helping send India C
        through to the final.[24] The following month, he was named as one of
        the eight players to watch ahead of the 2018–19 Ranji Trophy by
        ESPNcricinfo.[25] In December 2018, during the match against Tamil Nadu
        in the Ranji Trophy, Gill scored his maiden double century in
        first-class cricket, scoring 268 runs.[26] On 25 December 2018, on the
        fourth day of the match against Hyderabad in the Ranji Trophy, with
        Punjab needing 338 runs from 57 overs, Gill scored 148 off 154 balls,
        almost single-handedly taking his side to victory.
